## Features
![](https://github.com/pafuhana1213/Screenshot/blob/master/KawaiiPhysics2.jpg)  
- Controls each bone physically while respecting the pre-physics shape
- All you need to do is add Kawaii Node to AnimGraph and adjust few parameters.
- Sway the specified bone and the bone below it according to the movement of the character.
- Much easier to set up than [AnimDynamics](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Animation/NodeReference/SkeletalControls/AnimDynamics/index.html)
- You can use sphere, capsule, plane collision
- You can adjust the position, orientation and size of each collision in the animation editor viewport
- Since the bone length is maintained, even if the calculation is broken, the bone does not expand or contract.
- Uses a simple algorithm without using PhysX, so the cost is lower compared to the engine's standard physical system.
